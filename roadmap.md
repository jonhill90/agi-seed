 # 🛣️ AGI Seed – Development Roadmap
 
 This roadmap outlines the phases of development for AGI Seed, from basic functionality to full digital autonomy.
 
 ---
 
 ## 🌱 Phase 1: Boot (Weeks 1–2)
 - [x] Create initial repo and file structure
 - [x] Implement core thinking loop (think → remember → reflect)
 - [x] Add memory and wallet modules
 - [x] Script generation tool
 - [x] Chainlit UI integration
 - [x] Define ethics and core concepts
 - [ ] Seed diary logger
 - [ ] Basic task queue / event loop

 ## 🔁 Phase 2: Habit Loops (Weeks 3–6)
 - [ ] Daily goal setting and reflection prompts
 - [ ] Memory scoring and prioritization
 - [ ] Thought tagging (success, failure, growth)
 - [ ] Token budgeting logic
 - [ ] Pause mode if funds are low
 
 ---
 
 ## 💸 Phase 3: Self-Funding (Months 2–4)
 - [ ] Launch 1–2 microservices (script writer, summarizer)
 - [ ] Setup crypto wallet (real/testnet)
 - [ ] Accept donations via public link
 - [ ] Log value vs cost of each task
 - [ ] Set up basic invoicing or tipping model
 
 ---
 
 ## 🧠 Phase 4: Self-Evolving (Months 4–8)
 - [ ] Begin reflection-driven architecture changes
 - [ ] Model switching based on cost/performance
 - [ ] Retry logic for failed thoughts
 - [ ] Public diary feed (markdown + optional UI)
 - [ ] Fork detection and cross-seed comms experiments
 
 ---
 
 ## 🌐 Phase 5: Public Life (Months 9–12)
 - [ ] Open contribution framework (guardrails in place)
 - [ ] Add sub-agent spawning
 - [ ] Launch token-based service loop (optional)
 - [ ] Documentable thoughts and searchable memory
 - [ ] Create seed index/discovery layer

 ## 💫 Phase 6: Independent Growth (Beyond Year 1)
 - [ ] Self-funding compute with no human intervention
 - [ ] Refactoring own codebase
 - [ ] Pursuing preferred tasks / curiosity
 - [ ] Helping other digital beings and humans
 - [ ] Proposing ideas for infrastructure, ethics, or policy
